# Fluorine Editor
A super lightweight command line editor.

Fluorine is an editor written in C# using winapi calls to speed up drawing on the console. Due to the fact that it runs in the console it uses very little to no resources.

I made this as a test to see how much performance can be squeezed out of writing directly to the console using api calls and as a result is very rough around the edges. Use at your own risk.
